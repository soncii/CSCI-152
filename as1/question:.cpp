question:
why type size_t not just int?
should we include errors here with throw?
why do we need classes why do we need OOP? 
static dynamic typed langugages
will we use OOP to data structutres?
reference by value or type
why do we need references
how do we present it in memory
using constructors why when creating an object with assignment it invokes copy
